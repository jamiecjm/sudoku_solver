# Sudoku Solver
A fully-functioning Sudoku solver that can be run from the command line.

## Context
From Wikipedia's definition, Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids that compose that grid (also called "boxes") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

In a sudoku game, some of the squares will already have numbers. Usually there will be enough initial numbers to guarantee a unique solution.
